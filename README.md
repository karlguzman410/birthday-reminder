# birthday-reminder
Here's a little project I've followed along on Youtube. It is a 'birthday reminder' site which basically displays a list of people that are celebrating his/her birthday!

#The original project followed
Helped me setup the project structure, then the concept. A static site that displays a list of 'people' that are celebrating their 'birthdays'. The project had a hardcoded list
of people in the 'data.js' file.

#My goal for this project
1. To be able to call in some sort of either Google Calendar/Contacts API to pull in the data dynamically or add a feature for me to be able to login, then enter a 'person' object
with their info (name, age, dateofbirth, image)

2. To convert the page to be dynamic so when I login, the page will check for any 'person' with the date of birth that matches the date/time of login(so ultimately shows me who 
is actually celebrating their birthday on that day! )

This is part of a challenge, series that I am taking on to write and learn more of React, HTML/CSS, and to start more small little fun projects that I can quickly put together
(with the help of the course/tutorial) I am following, then add in the changes/features I want/need to make it my own.
